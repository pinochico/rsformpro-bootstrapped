RSForm Pro Bootstrapped
=================

Although RSForms Pro comes with a HTML5 Responsive layout it lacks the Bootstrap Layout. RSForm Pro Bootstrapped provides the Bootstrap Layout.


Quick Start
-----------

1 add the peace of javascript from script.js to the <head> of yor template, just before </head>
What this does is it changes the class of the form.
 When screen width < 766 it removes class form-horizontal.
 When screen width >= 766 it adds class form-horizontal.

2 add css from local.css to your website css. Don't add to bootsctrap.css!

3 Make sure you backup /administrator/components/com_rsform first ...

4 unzip rsformhack in the root of your site
 This adds and overwrites some file under /administrator/components/com_rsform

Tooltips by Bootstrapx Clickover
-----------
For the tooltip I've implemented Bootstrapx Clickover. It provides enhancements to Twitter Bootstrap Popovers to allow popovers to be opened/closed with click events and some other niceities. You can download and install the necessary files from https://github.com/lecar-red/bootstrapx-clickover


Hope you get it all working!
