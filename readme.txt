To do:

1) add the peace of javascript from script.js to the <head> of yor template, just before </head>
What this does is it changes the class of the form.
When screen width < 766 it removes class form-horizontal.
When screen width >= 766 it adds class form-horizontal.

2) add css from local.css to your website css. Don't add to bootsctrap.css!

3) Make sure you backup /administrator/components/com_rsform first ...

4) unzip rsformhack in the root of your site
This adds and overwrites some file under /administrator/components/com_rsform

Hope you get it all working!
